# Guide for Tech-consultants

## Students coursework organizations:
This is a course repository where all students have their work in the current semester: individual and group/team work.

  As a tech consultant, you will need to:
  - Create these organizations.
  - Uploading the logo.
  - Add students and the course instructor to the organization.
  - Manage the workflow of the organization.
  - Create the required repositories.
  - Help instructors and/or students with any Git related issues.

- **Creating the organization:**
    You can either create a new organization or rename the previously used organization for this course after recycling the content, which means Students Coursework Organizations need to get recycled at the end of the semester after grades are submitted. (Deleting all student repos, Starter code and solutions repos moved to Course Materials)

  - Naming convention:  year-term-comp-xxx OR year-term-comp-uuu-ggg (for cross-listed courses)

  - Access rights: The course instructor and lab assistant should have owner access to this organization.

  - Request students list from the course instructor.

  - To add students to this organization, you require their GitHub usernames.

    Email all the students for their usernames.
    Add the students to this organization as members.

- **Creating teams in Organization:**
  - Create a team named “Students” with all the students in that course.

    To do this,
	  Go to Teams ---> New team ---> Enter team name(different naming conventions for different repositories, which is mentioned further in this document), Description is not mandatory, Team Visibility: “Visible”. Create team.

    Now, add all the students in this team and create.
	  Further, sub-teams can be created in this “Students” team. This is mostly done for team assignments/projects.


  - Repositories:

    All the students in the “Students” team can create their own repositories in the organization.

    Each student will be a member of multiple repositories in this organization: Few as a contributor and few as a reader.

    If a repository is created by tech-consultant, it needs to be empty so that no synchronization issues arise when pushing local to remote.

    Types of repos:
    - Starter code repositories
    - Individual student repositories
    - Team homework repos
    - Team project repositories


    Steps to create EMPTY repositories:
    - Naming convention:
      - Individual Student repos: Firstname-lastname
      - Team homework repos: homeworkname-xxx-yyy, where xxx and yyy are github usernames/first names of the students in the team.
      - Homework and lab solution repos: homework/lab name-solution
      Team project repos: projectnumber-xxx-yyy-zzz


    Creating repository from github.com website:
      1. Click on New and enter the repo name. Please follow naming convention.
      2. Select visibility: Private
      3. Click on Create repository.


    Now, you must give access to the student who should own that repository. The student should be given “write” access to this repository.
    For team repos: The respective sub-team in the ”Students” team should be given “write” access. All other teams will have “read” access.

-------------------
## Course Materials organizations:
  Course organization for course instructor and assistant. Materials include starter code repositories, lab and homework solution repositories.

  - Naming convention: coursename. For example, data-structures-fundamentals, full-stack-development, etc.

  - Access rights: Course Instructor and lab assistant will be the owners. Students DO NOT have access.

  **Note:** As a tech consultant, you need to make sure that all the required content from the students’ coursework organization is uploaded to this organization. This material will be utilized in further semesters.


  - Repositories:
    - Course static website repository:
      This is the GitHub pages website for the course with naming convention: compxxx.github.io, where xxx is Course ID.

      Please go through [https://unh-aes-resources.github.io/docs/github-pages-setup/](https://unh-aes-resources.github.io/docs/github-pages-setup/) to set up GitHub pages.

    - Starter Code repositories
    - Lab and homework solution repositories.

    Starter code and solutions repos are moved from students coursework org to this org at the end of each semester.

    ``Please follow the steps from the previous section to create repositories. ``
