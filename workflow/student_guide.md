# Guide for Students
## Student Coursework organization:

This is a course-specific organization where students have all their work during the semester. This can be individual homework, team works, and projects.

**You are member of this Organization:** A tech-consultant will be adding you to this organization as a member. Please accept the invitation.

**Teams:** Now, you will be added to the “Students” team. For the team homework/projects, you will be further added to sub-teams and will have “write” access to this repo.

**Repositories:**
As a member of the “**Students**” team, you can create your own repo. Make sure that the repo is private. Course Instructor, lab assistant and/or other students should be given “read” access for your repo.

**Note:** If this repo is for individual submission, no other student should have “read” access unless and until instructed by the instructor.

A *starter code repository* will be uploaded to this org which needs to be cloned by students for that week. As a student, you will have read access to this repo. More information regarding the starter code repos will be provided by the instructor in class.

For *team homework/labs or team projects repositories*, the tech-consultant will create the corresponding repo. Then, the particular team, created for this purpose in which you are a member, will be given ”write” access. All other teams will have “read” access to these repositories.
